# Code Review

## Code Review Guidelines

The following documents code review processes for the Beman Project organization.

* As stated in [repository.codeowners](https://github.com/bemanproject/beman/blob/main/docs/beman_standard.md#repositorycodeowners), a list of local reviewers is available for each repository, and automated code review rules are enforced via [repository.code_review_rules](https://github.com/bemanproject/beman/blob/main/docs/beman_standard.md#repositorycode_review_rules).

* By default, all PRs are reviewed by at least one code owner.

* PRs created by codeowners can be merged without review, but it is a good practice to offer other codeowners an opportunity to review the PR by providing a 24-hour grace period.
