# The Beman Project

## About

### Mission

The Beman Project's [mission](/docs/mission.md) is to **support the efficient design and adoption of the highest quality C++ standard libraries** through implementation experience, user feedback, and technical expertise.

### Community

We have two principle audiences: Library Developers and the C++ community.
We want to allow Library Developers to have a clear path on the road to Standardization.
And we want to make it easy for the C++ community to use these libraries to ensure we have real world usage.

### Governance

This project is organized by our [Governance](/docs/governance.md) structure.

### Participating and contributing


We welcome all to participate in the Beman project through 
[Discourse](https://discourse.bemanproject.org) discussions or GitHub contributions. Our discourse community is the best way to stay up to
date with the most recent developments.

If you are looking for ways to contribute code, see the open issues of [bemanproject repositories](https://github.com/orgs/bemanproject/repositories).
The [beman repository's issue list](https://github.com/bemanproject/beman/issues), in particular, has implementation requests for various papers.
Issues marked with `good first issue` are perfect for new contributors and usually have an assigned mentor. Don't hesitate to post on discourse with any questions.

Please refer to our [Code of Conduct](/docs/code_of_conduct.md) and the [Beman Standard](/docs/beman_standard.md) for further information about the community and
